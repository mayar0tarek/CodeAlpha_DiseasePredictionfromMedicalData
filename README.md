# CodeAlpha_LiverDiseasePrediction



Project Description

Welcome to my latest project on disease prediction using medical data, specifically focusing on liver disease prediction. This project, hosted on CodeAlpha, represents a culmination of efforts in data science and machine learning, aimed at developing predictive models to facilitate early detection and intervention for liver-related issues.

Methodology Highlights:

Data Collection: The project begins with the collection of medical data pertinent to liver disease prediction. This involves sourcing relevant datasets containing features such as age, gender, and various blood test results.

Preprocessing: The collected data undergoes rigorous preprocessing to ensure its suitability for model development. This step includes handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical features.

Feature Engineering: Feature engineering plays a crucial role in extracting meaningful insights from the data. This phase involves creating new features, transforming existing ones, and selecting the most relevant features to enhance model performance.

Model Development: Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, including RandomForest and XGBoost algorithms, predictive models are developed to classify patients into liver and non-liver categories based on the provided medical data.

Model Evaluation: The developed models are rigorously evaluated using a robust evaluation framework. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to assess the models' effectiveness in predicting liver disease.
